I can totally see a timeline of personal computing where Apple was never founded, and I would’ve been really sad.</p> <p>Because I like to be mobile, I don’t really like to use any external devices (ie. external monitor, keyboard, mouse)—I don’t think any other computer except a Macbook can let me do this.</p> <p>Anyways, here is the comprehensive list of all the devices that I own and use.</p> <h3>Laptop</h3> <p>My daily driver is the 2025 13-inch Macbook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Sky Blue).</p> <p>Last week, I recently upgraded from my trusty old Macbook Air from 2020 (M1, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD). It still works great though, so I handed it off to the parents.</p> <h3>Phone</h3> <p>I use the iPhone 15 Pro (128GB, Blue Titanium). For the longest time, I was rocking the iPhone SE that had like a 2-hour battery life, 64GB of storage, so this was a very welcome upgrade.</p> <h3>Tablet</h3> <p>I use a 11-inch iPad Pro (Wi-Fi, 128GB, Space Gray). I bought this in my first semester of college in 2022, and I used it a ton in my freshman and sophomore year, mostly to take notes and do homework. Recently though, I’ve been preferring physical paper a lot more, so my iPad has not really been used much these past few months.</p> <h3>Server</h3> <p>This doesn’t really goes under hardware, but I’ll just put it in this section anyways.</p> <p>I have a VPS on DigitalOcean that I pay for with credits from the Github Student Developer pack. I’ve been planning to host more projects on it, but haven’t gotten around to building anything particularly interesting.</p> <p>Currently, I just use it to host share.kylehe.com, which is a super simple file hosting software that I use for personal use, when I need to quickly send files from one device to another.</p> <p>It’s lowkey super jank though, and I only really use this when I have to send a PDF to a friend or I need to send something to a random device like a library computer.</p> <h2>Software</h2> <h3>Web Browser</h3> <p>I like Arc. If you had asked me last year, I probably would’ve said I loved it. However, the team at The Browser Company are EOL’ing Arc, only pushing stability and Chromium fixes—and there has been a growing number of little annoying glitches. I think they are planning on replacing Arc with some AI-first browser. Which makes me kinda sad.</p> <h3>Development</h3> <p>I use Cursor as my main IDE, and I like it a lot so far! I rarely pay for software, so it’s pretty high praise that they were able to convince me to shell out $20/month. I actually had it installed back in 2023 when it first came out, but stopped using it because a lot of things failed to work. However, over the past year, they have really stepped up their game: Tab and Agent actually works!</p> <p>I use iTerm2 as my terminal emulator.</p> <h3>Productivity</h3> <p>I used to use Notion pretty heavily, followed by Obsidian. While I liked both pieces of software, I realized that I don’t really be taking notes like that to warrant using a PKM—maybe when I start working full time and start having regular work meetings, I might pick up Obsidian again.</p> <p>So now, I’ve mostly just been rawdogging the Apple Notes app + pen and paper.</p> <p>I write documents using Typst and the Tinymist extension has been one of the best writing experiences ever.</p> <h3>Misc</h3> <p>Here are some pieces of software that I like, in no particular order.</p> <p>I really really like Raycast. Raycast is super fast and has some pretty awesome features. Its calculator / conversion app is amazingly good, and supports so many features out of the box. I should honestly use it for more utilities, but I mostly just use it to resize my windows, run quick conversions and calculations, view my clipboard history, and find/open apps. No complaints!</p> <p>I use Shottr for screenshots. I like that it allows me to quickly OCR text from the screen, and mark up screenshots.</p> <p>I use Zed to simple text editor to quickly manipulate and write scripts.</p> <p>I use IINA to play video files. I use it because it handles a larger variety of video files (ex. MKV files).</p> <h3>OS / Package Managment</h3> <p>Recently, I started using Nix to manage my installations, and it seems pretty nice so far. In my old computer, one of my biggest gripes was having tons of random installs that I had installed over the years, and I didn’t really have a clear picture of what was exactly installed on my computer, but Nix helps a lot in fixing that.</p> <p>I also started versioning my dotfiles and managing the symlinks using <code>stow</code> and it’s been pretty nice so far.</p>",1);function r(t){var a=n();s(72),i(t,a)}const y=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:r,metadata:e},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}));export{y as _};
