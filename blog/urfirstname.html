      <h1>about</h1>
      <p>A while back, I came across the word, sonder - n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure if it is just me, but recently I've begun stalking other people's Spotify profiles and checking out what kinds of playlists they are listening to. The idea of sonder stuck with me, and it led me to wonder what the music they listen to defines the stage of life they are in and the experiences they are going through.</p>
      <p>Anyways, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0k9fDhZAvc7yvVshCCtHjJ?si=af7c30b2291b4379">this playlist</a> contains a collection of songs that mean a little something to me, some of them making up a part of my high school experience. So, here is a detailed explanation of this playlist. I basically wrote this entire thing in a burst of motivation at 1AM one night so parts of it are kinda scuff and boohoo I don't want to read this again. </p>

      <h1>older - alec benjamin</h1>
      <p>I'm moving on to a new stage of my life. Throughout the past 12 years of my life, I've been around the same people, growing up with them and seeing them grow up. Now that I'm going off to college, I'm realizing that many of the interactions that I have over the next few months will be some of the last ones that I'll have with a lot of people. You know that meme, "there's gonna be the last time we play on a playground, a last time we log on to minecraft with the boys, a last time we hang out" Like the song says: "I'm not prepared for the future &hellip; guess my childhood is over."&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This is a heartache playlist, and this song sets the tone for the rest of the songs. I've had crushes before, but they were just phases&mdash;they just come and go. But, some of them stick with you and shape who you are as a person. <br /><br />You never really forget "THE" first high school crush&mdash;the first love&mdash;and it really tells the story of moving on well. Quoting an <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/nicole-garbanzos/2020/01/the-truth-is-nothing-can-compare-to-your-very-first-love/">article </a>I read, "The magic in first loves is innocent, pure, and unfazed." Maturing is the acceptance that you are in love with the IDEA of them. But it still fucking sucks.&nbsp;</p>

      <h1>heat waves (with iann dior) - glass animals</h1>
      <p>This song is one of the big hits from 2020, and it takes me back to quarantine. COVID-19 has really shaped my highschool experience, and just thinking about it is nostalgic. Quarantine is an experience like nothing we've had before.</p>
      <p>I really only rediscovered this gem in 2021. I distinctly remember blasting it through headphones, biking around my neighborhood without hands, and almost quite literally thinking about them in "late night[s] in the middle of June."</p>
      <p>I still remember the night I asked the big question. I'm glad I asked, but sometimes I wish I never did—I knew it would change the dynamic of the friendship forever, and I miss it. The next morning, when I saw her in online class, her eyes were red like she had just finished crying. I will never know what happened and what she was thinking, but back then I was just so confused and I didn't know how to process it. Even now, I'm not sure how I can put the few awkward days afterwards into words.</p>
      <p>We never talked much in person again.</p>
      <p> From the original song: "You look so broken when you cry/ one more than then I say goodbye" We talked for a while online, but I think we both knew our fragile relationship was over. In some ways, just like this song, we were in each other's quarantine phase. We were both lonely and bored, and afterwards I realized I had just "woken up from the longest dream."</p>

      <h1>blue bird - della</h1>
      <p>This is one of the main songs from the Love is Sweet OST. Not much in this one, I just had this on repeat for a while, and I've probably teared up a bit to this song more than a dozen times. Reminds me of them.</p>

      <h1>starboy - the weeknd</h1>
      <p>This song doesn't really hold much sentimental value, it just sounds so good.</p>
      <p>There's strong imagery of drugs, money, girls — the classic Starboy stuff. I really kinda spiraled a bit, and I fell into a trap of regret and self-"hate?" for a while, becoming increasingly reckless and putting myself in bad situations. I filled my life with excitement too, but at the end of the day it still leaves you empty… there's kinda an air of emptiness to this TURNUP I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD type song.</p>

      <h1>die for you - the weeknd</h1>
      <p>This song tells the story of the end of a relationship, where both parts still love one another, and they both know that they are perfect together. Yet, circumstances pull them apart and they beat themselves up over it. The big what if.</p>
      <p>The worst part of moving on is knowing that you still have hidden feelings for them deep down, and you wish things could've turned out differently. Despite the mask of "nah it's in the past," you would still jump at any chance to be with them again in a heartbeat.</p>
      <p>I'm scared I won't be able to find someone like them again.</p>

      <h1>Rêverie L.68 - Claude Debussy</h1>
      <p>classical music break. nothing much.</p>

      <h1>(spoilers) 스물다섯, 스물하나 (25/21) - Jaurim </h1>
      <p>25/21 is one of those dramas that hits you like a train and stays with you long after you've finished it. I've never really watched a drama quite like this one.</p>
      <p>It portrays the story of growth, of a blossoming relationship where they help one another push through their struggles. This show is set after the IMF Korean financial crisis in 1997: companies went bankrupt, people lost their jobs, programs were shut down.</p>
      <p>The female lead (Na Hee-do) , who had been fencing her whole life suddenly had that torn away from her and the male lead (Baek Yi-jin) once the son of a wealthy conglomerate owner went completely bankrupt and had to drop out of college.</p>
      <p>They meet each other at their darkest moments and find comfort in one another's company. They meet each other at their darkest moments and find comfort in one another's company. Eventually, as they find success and catch feelings, they end up in a relationship. However, as their lives grow increasingly distant and busy, they drift apart. The last few episodes are what truly differentiates this show: in a series of heartbreaking encounters, they realize they couldn't be together anymore, and move on. I held on to the hope that this kdrama would have a kdrama ending, but in the end it's just the story of a first love. Realistic but wtf.</p>
      <p>I probably wasn't her Baek Yi-jin and she probably rarely thinks about me at all anymore. But, she was my Nam Hee-do. I was in a pretty shitty place in my life back then, I had just finished my freshman year and I was young and dumb. I was immature and I had some pretty toxic and crude friends, and I just felt…alone. I'm not sure what about her made me realize what kind of person I wanted to be, maybe it was her innocence or wanting to impress her.</p>
      <p>Those few months where I really got to know her, I learned about who I wanted and improved myself and those I surrounded myself with. She was a first for many things: she was the first girl I held hands with, first girl I hugged, first girl I went on impulsive walks with, first girl I napped with at a park with our jackets laid out like blankets. And for the first time in my life, even when things sucked, I could sit down and think, "damn. i'm content."</p>
      <p>This song is the midpoint of this playlist, and the rest is basically the same. Every time I meet someone with her first name, it feels weird. I often catch myself growing closer to someone or doing something that reminds me of something I did with her and I do a full stop and rewind. It's like I have a fear of intimacy and of being hurt again. Glimpse of Us by Joji is especially painful because I have a fear that I'll continue to compare my future relationships with my first encounter with what I think is love.</p>
