I recently read a blog post, [Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/), and I thought it gave some pretty compelling reasons to start a blog. A few points that stood out to me were "writing helps you think better" and "there is value in unoriginal writing." 

I wanted to additionally add a few of my reasons for starting this:

a. With large language models getting better, I realized that I've been forming original thoughts and producing original writing a lot less, which is quite sad. I think I want to write/think more. 

b. I think I tend to BFS-think a lotâ€”-I have a bunch of random ideas that need a lot more development before it becomes a cohesive thought. I want to think a bit more deeply about these BFS-thoughts, and I think using a blog format would help with that.
