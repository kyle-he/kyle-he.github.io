I recently came across a blog post titled [Why You Should Start a Blog Right Now](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/). It presented some compelling reasons to begin blogging. Two points that particularly resonated with me were: "writing helps you think better" and "there is value in unoriginal writing."

Also, I wanted to additionally add a few of my reasons for starting a place to publish and store writing:

1. With large language models getting better, I realized that I've been thinking a lot less, which is quite sad. 

2. On a related note: I tend to BFS-think a lot, and I think the act of writing out my thoughts will help me better crystallize my ideas.
