The season 1 finale of Common Side Effects just came out today, and I can't believe no one is talking about this show. 

While I tend to be pretty easy to please, I truly believe that this is Adult Swim's "Breaking Bad" if they are able to continue to develop the story further next season, and wrap it up well. 

To preface, I don't watch a lot of cartoons. And based on my conversations with my friends, I feel like a lot of people
are really put off by the medium, which I totally understand.
