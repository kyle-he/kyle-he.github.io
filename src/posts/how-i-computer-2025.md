I love learning about how other people use their devices—I've discovered many great applications and useful tricks by seeing how my friends computer. 

So ... here is how I computer in 2025. 

## Hardware
No glaze, but I love Apple devices and I'm so glad they exist as a company. I can totally see a timeline of personal computing where Apple was never founded, and I would've been really sad. 

Because I like to be mobile, I don't really like to use any external devices (ie. external monitor, keyboard, mouse)—I don't think any other computer except a Macbook can let me do this. 

Anyways, here is the comprehensive list of all the devices that I own and use. 

### Laptop
My daily driver is the 2025 13-inch Macbook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Sky Blue).

Last week, I recently upgraded from my trusty old Macbook Air from 2020 (M1, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD). It still works great though, so I handed it off to the parents. 

### Phone
I use the iPhone 15 Pro (128GB, Blue Titanium). For the longest time, I was rocking the iPhone SE that had like a 2-hour battery life, 64GB of storage, so this was a very welcome upgrade. 

### Tablet
I use a 11-inch iPad Pro (Wi-Fi, 128GB, Space Gray). I bought this in my first semester of college in 2022, and I used it a ton in my freshman and sophomore year, mostly to take notes and do homework. Recently though, I've been preferring physical paper a lot more, so my iPad has not really been used much these past few months. 

### Server
This doesn't really goes under hardware, but I'll just put it in this section anyways.

I have a VPS on DigitalOcean that I pay for with credits from the Github Student Developer pack. I've been planning to host more projects on it, but haven't gotten around to building anything particularly interesting. 

Currently, I just use it to host share.kylehe.com, which is a super simple file hosting software that I use for personal use, when I need to quickly send files from one device to another. 

It's lowkey super jank though, and I only really use this when I have to send a PDF to a friend or I need to send something to a random device like a library computer. 

## Software

### Web Browser
I like Arc. If you had asked me last year, I probably would've said I loved it. However, the team at The Browser Company are EOL'ing Arc, only pushing stability and Chromium fixes--and there has been a growing number of little annoying glitches. I think they are planning on replacing Arc with some AI-first browser. Which makes me kinda sad. 

### Development
I use Cursor as my main IDE, and I like it a lot so far! I rarely pay for software, so it's pretty high praise that they were able to convince me to shell out $20/month. I actually had it installed back in 2023 when it first came out, but stopped using it because a lot of things failed to work. However, over the past year, they have really stepped up their game: Tab and Agent actually works!

I use iTerm2 as my terminal emulator.

### Productivity
I used to use Notion pretty heavily, followed by Obsidian. While I liked both pieces of software, I realized that I don't really be taking notes like that to warrant using a PKM--maybe when I start working full time and start having regular work meetings, I might pick up Obsidian again.

So now, I've mostly just been rawdogging the Apple Notes app + pen and paper. 

I write documents using Typst and the Tinymist extension has been one of the best writing experiences ever. 

### Misc
Here are some pieces of software that I like, in no particular order. 

I really really like Raycast. Raycast is super fast and has some pretty awesome features. Its calculator / conversion app is amazingly good, and supports so many features out of the box. I should honestly use it for more utilities, but I mostly just use it to resize my windows, run quick conversions and calculations, view my clipboard history, and find/open apps. No complaints!

I use Shottr for screenshots. I like that it allows me to quickly OCR text from the screen, and mark up screenshots. 

I use Zed to simple text editor to quickly manipulate and write scripts. 

I use IINA to play video files. I use it because it handles a larger variety of video files (ex. MKV files).

### OS / Package Managment
Recently, I started using Nix to manage my installations, and it seems pretty nice so far. In my old computer, one of my biggest gripes was having tons of random installs that I had installed over the years, and I didn't really have a clear picture of what was exactly installed on my computer, but Nix helps a lot in fixing that. 

I also started versioning my dotfiles and managing the symlinks using `stow` and it's been pretty nice so far.
